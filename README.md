# KIFT

A voice recognition program for 42 university, group project with dgerard, anazar, dnelson and mlu.

There is four main parts to the project:
1) Sphinx voice recognition in C
2) Server side modulation and handling AI behavior
3) Client side front end UI allowing users to see the actions and behaviors
4) Intergration and QA between all three above for smooth easy program to use and play with

Idea behind the project is to learn about Sphinx and how to use it to read input from the users voice and output/react with specific behaviors. We've designed a web client that speaks to our voice AI and helps to simulate a robotic dog AI that talks to you. We gave the AI "Goodboye" pseudo-sentient feel and the capabilities of performing multiple actions based of the project criterium.
